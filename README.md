# SolarDrip

Aim of this project is to create a drop in replacement PCB for low cost solar irrigation systems to allow integration into home automation setups like home-assistant.

## Features

  * solar and usb-c charging
  * basic battery management
  * pump control
  * 2 capacitative sensors (soil & water level)
  * i2c available for additional actors or sensors
  * spare GPIOs

## Hardware

The PCB fits this [solar irrigation system](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006386588305.html). Other, similar systems might be compatible as well. Connecting a pump, 18650 battery and a big enough 6V solar panel should be enough.
